# NeuralNetwork
Simple Neural Network implementation with only numpy.  
**!!!Important!!!**  
Due to file size restrictions, training images in the ./data folder are compressed into a .rar file, before using the dataset user must unrar the file into the ./data folder.

NN-Implement.ipnyb file shows the implementation of the Neural Network using the code provided in NeuralNetwork.py.  
Experimental.ipnyb file contains different experiments made with the Neural Networks. This file provides information about the different structured models and comparison of the training and test accuracies alongside validation cost and computation time.
